List of changes I have made to make the portfolio fit me better:

1. Changed the Logo to better represent my creative side of web designing and programming.

2. Changed the main picture in the Jumbotron because I felt like the illustration looked very similar to me doing my work.
(kept the little click to play animation because if I had more time I would likely make it an animated short describing me and my work.)

3. I made the Testimonials section a reviews section because I would think it is more relevent to show what people think about me and my work.

4. Made the FAQ section common questions that people would ask me about me, I actually do get these quesitons a lot when I'm off walking around the Weber State Campus!

5. In the Latest work section, I added a bunch of those pictures that I thought would best describe what I would be doing after I finish my bachelors degree. I wanted to make sure one of them was
an iPad because I use mine literally every single day.

6. I tweaked the Getting started section into being more of a commission form for if someone wanted to start a project/hire me. I think it really relates to what I would be doing as a job 
in the future.

7. In the Resume section, I wanted to include some of my experience and my education that I went though to show I am qualified to do the projects that customers would want. Education is 
definitely an important aspect to add to a portfolio page.

8. Also in the Resume Section, I wanted to include my skills and most of the programming languages that I have learned along the way. When it comes to programming, it is defintiely important to use specific 
programming languages for the job. (i.e. html for websites, java for games, etc.)

9. I decided to make the Projects section more descriptive about me and what I enjoy doing, the illustrations I picked really fit in nicely with my overall style of this website!

10. Finally, I changed the colors to be more a cool or soothing purple to blue gradient. I felt like that made the page more easy on the eyes while also sticking with the purple throughout the rest of the 
page. I also made the waves a little bit more wavy (I know right, so original), but it kinda adds to the blue-watery vibe. Which also adds to the fact that I like to draw and paint a lot on my iPad.
